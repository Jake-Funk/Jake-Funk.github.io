PlanGex is a genetic database CRUD application I built while volunteering as a research assistant and developer for <a href="https://lobolab.umbc.edu/" class="link link-primary" target="_blank">UMBC's Lobo Lab</a>. PlanGex exposes a REST API and a simple frontend that lets lab members search through, sort, organize, and export data from the lab's planarian worm genetics database.

PlanGex also helps the lab members find publications that mention specific genes, as well as visualizations of predicted gene expression patterns from known outcomes in published experiments.
