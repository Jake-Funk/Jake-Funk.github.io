PlanGex is a genetic database CRUD application I built while volunteering as a research assistant and developer for <a href="https://lobolab.umbc.edu/" class="link link-primary">UMBC's Lobo Lab</a>. PlanGex uses a REST API and a simplistic frontend to help lab members search through, sort, and organize data from our planarian worm genetics database.

Users can find recent publications that mention specific genes, as well as view visualizations of predicted gene expression patterns using known outcomes from published experiments.
