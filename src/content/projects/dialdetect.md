Dial Detect is a side project I built with a friend of mine in the marketing industry. It's a tool for affiliate marketers and lead gen sales people to automate their direct inbound dialing (DID) services.

The frontend is all Next.js and the backend is the same, with connections to supabase for the DB. twilio for voice over IP (VoIP) and stripe for payments.
